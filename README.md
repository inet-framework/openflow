# OpenFlow model for OMNeT++ and the INET Framework

Simulation model of the OpenFlow system based on the OpenFlow switch
specification 1.0.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for communication networks
which separates the control plane from the data plane of forwarding elements.
This way, SDN constitutes a flexible architecture that allows quick and easy
configuration of network devices. OpenFlow is a well-known implementation of the
SDN concept and offers a high flexibility in the routing of network flows.

The model was originally presented at the 6th International Workshop on OMNeT++
by authors Dominik Klein and Michael Jarschel of University of WÃ¼rzburg, for
INET-2.0 and OMNeT++ 4.2. In later years, the code was ported to newer INET and
OMNeT++ versions independently by multiple teams and individuals, resulting in
several forked repositories. A notable fork is maintained by the CoRE research
group at the HAW-Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences), extended to
work together with the CoRE simulation models. This repository has also taken
the CoRE group's fork as a starting point.
